"""Split stage — DETERMINISTIC (doctrine B4: index / store split).

Turns scored ideas into two cross-linked sets of in-memory note objects that
mirror the Memory Doctrine's on-disk schema:

* **axiom notes** — the *index*: thin, navigable claims carrying the scores and
  the ids of the evidence they cite.
* **evidence notes** — the *store*: one note per distinct source, holding the
  verbatim snippet(s). Multiple axioms that rest on the same source share a
  single evidence note (de-duplication by source) — this *is* the B4 split.

Nothing is written to disk here (that is the assemble stage, M3). Ids are
generated deterministically via stable slugs so the same input always yields the
same ids, and **every axiom's ``evidence`` id is guaranteed to resolve** to an
emitted evidence note (the doctrine lint requires this downstream).
