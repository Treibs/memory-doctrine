"""Verify stage — LLM adversarial (doctrine E4: refute by default + citation presence).

For each :class:`ScoredIdea` this stage runs two gates:

1. **Citation-presence** (deterministic). An idea must cite at least one real
   supporting snippet drawn from the sources. An idea with no supporting snippet
   fails immediately — confidence is earned from evidence actually present, never
   from fluency. This gate runs WITHOUT any LLM, so it always holds.

2. **Refute-by-default** (LLM). A ``complete_json`` call that tries to *break*
   the idea given only its snippets, returning
   ``{survives: bool, reason, adjusted_confidence}``. Ideas that do not survive
   are dropped; survivors are down-scored to the confidence the present evidence
   licenses (never raised above their prior confidence).

The LLM dependency is injected as a ``complete_json(prompt, schema) -> dict``
callable, so this stage is fully testable WITHOUT an API key: pass a fake
callable that returns fixed JSON.
