"""kpm_builder.orchestrate — end-to-end MVP pipeline.

``build_mvp`` wires the full engine flow for ONE core question + ONE manual
beat + N sources (each with a pre-drafted claim).  It is designed to be
exercised deterministically by the integration test (fake complete_json) and
driven with a real provider (run_mvp.py).

Flow
----
For each (source, claim) pair:
  1. Snapshot the source with an injected fetcher.
  2. Gate A: classify_tier(source).
  3. Gate B: is_relevant(source, contract).  Drop irrelevant sources.
  4. ground(claim, snapshot) → verdict.
  5. confidence(tier, n_independent_corroborations, ground_verdict,
     contradiction=False) — the corroboration count is COMPUTED per claim:
     the number of distinct independent sources (by domain) whose grounding
     verdict entails the same statement (REVIEW.md KPM-M7 / EFF-5).

Coverage labeling (per core question):
  6. grounded = all kept claims have verdict "entails"
     n_quality_sources = number of sources that passed both gates
  7. question_state → CoverageState; assemble a CoverageReport (CONVERGED).
  8. decide(report) → BuildOutcome.

Shipping:
  9. Only SHIPPABLE ideas (verdict == "entails") go through strip → split →
     assemble → validate.  over_claims / reject claims are surfaced in the
     coverage report as PARTIAL/ABSTAINED but never shipped as supported axioms.

Verdict-to-state mapping for the coverage row:
  - ALL kept claims entailed           → ANSWERED
  - ≥1 over_claims / reject, ≥1 kept  → PARTIAL
  - no sources passed both gates       → ABSTAINED (n_quality_sources=0)
  - n_quality_sources < 2              → ABSTAINED (per label.question_state)

    ----------
    contract:
        Research scope definition (goal, in_scope, out_of_scope).
    beat_question:
        The single core question this MVP addresses.
    sources:
        Pre-loaded sources (url + text + venue).  Must have the same length as
        ``claims`` — sources[i] is the source for claims[i].
    claims:
        Pre-drafted claims, one per source.
    complete_json:
        Injected LLM callable ``(prompt, schema) -> dict``.  In tests: a fake.
        In production: ``make_provider(Family.DEEPSEEK)``.
    out_dir:
        Destination directory for the assembled KPM package.
    fetched_at:
        ISO timestamp for snapshots (injected — never clock-calls here).
    run_date:
        ``YYYY-MM-DD`` for the evidence ``verified`` field (injected).
    supporting_passages:
        Optional, aligned with ``claims`` — the exact passage from sources[i]
        that entailed claims[i].  When present, the shipped evidence span is
        scoped to that passage (REVIEW.md KPM-H5); when ``None`` (or an entry
        is ``None``), the span falls back to the whole document.
    package_name / package_description:
        Package manifest fields passed to assemble.

        The decide() verdict: is_kpm, label, coverage report.
