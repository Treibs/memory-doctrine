## The model

Memory is a retrieval-optimized network of confidence-weighted *generative* truths. Value lives in the edges and retrieval paths — not in the nodes themselves: a node's meaning is constituted entirely by its pattern of connections, and every edge spends from a finite per-node budget (the fan law). A KPM is the portable, distilled form of that network for a domain: it ships the irreducible generators of the domain's knowledge (not elaborations, not summaries), scored with earned evidential confidence, split into a sparse axiom index and a rich evidence store, and packaged with the operators needed to revise it. Because the generators transfer, the KPM transfers; because the confidence is evidence-gated, the KPM is auditable.

## The seven clusters

- **[A · Structure](clusters/A-structure.md)** — how knowledge is shaped: weighted edges, atomicity, foundherentist justification
- **[B · Retrieval](clusters/B-retrieval.md)** — how knowledge is recalled: spreading-activation = Hopfield = attention, cue-dependence, the capacity cliff, index/store split
- **[C · Truth](clusters/C-truth.md)** — confidence, correctness, and the limits of both: confidence earned not inferred, three independent orderings, confabulation risk, salience firewall
- **[D · Dynamics](clusters/D-dynamics.md)** — how knowledge changes over time: retrievability decay, novelty-gated write, MTT-safe consolidation, revision operators
- **[E · Method](clusters/E-method.md)** — how to build and validate a KPM: layered distillation, retrieval practice, adversarial verification, lint/compile operators
- **[F · Meta](clusters/F-meta.md)** — what the doctrine knows about itself: convergence-corroboration, contradictions as category errors, the Surprise Principle, the B1 = B4 cognitive-map unification
- **[G · Prospective](clusters/G-prospective.md)** — agentic and future-directed memory: trigger memory, intention lifecycle (agentic KPMs only)

## Two unifications worth the price of admission

The doctrine earns its keep where it *collapses* things people treat as separate:

- **The Surprise Principle (F3)** — salience-gating, novelty-gated writes, and predictive coding are not three mechanisms; they are *one quantity* — prediction error — observed at three levels (behavioral, dopaminergic, cortical).
- **The cognitive-map unification (F4)** — embeddings-as-geometry (B1) and the sparse-index→rich-store (B4) are the *same object*: a cognitive map. A KPM is structurally a factorized cognitive map, which is *why* its generators transfer.

## Operators (the productions)

A portable KPM ships axioms *and* the rules to revise them — the operators are its procedural memory.

- **[D4 · Contract](operators/D4-contract.md)** — on contradiction, minimally shrink the belief set per AGM; never delete evidence
- **[D5 · Suppress](operators/D5-suppress.md)** — lower a belief's retrievability without touching its confidence or evidence; reversible, auditable
- **[E3 · Lint](operators/E3-lint.md)** — mechanical pre-lock gate: atomicity, evidence presence, frontmatter-body sync, F2 invariant
- **[E5 · Compile](operators/E5-compile.md)** — on impasse, distill the resolution path into a candidate new generator; must pass E4 before ignition

## How this package is built

The structure is self-exemplifying. The 23 atomic axiom notes *are* the index (B4's sparse index layer); the 41 evidence notes *are* the store (B4's rich content layer); this README is the distilled spine (E1's generator layer sitting above the elaboration). The lint gate runs automatically: `scripts/doctrine_lint.py` (0 violations). Every promoted axiom has been adversarially challenged and independently grounded (E4). Confidence fields are set from evidence, never from retrieval frequency or fluency (C1).

## How to use it

This doctrine is the rubric a knowledge-packaging skill or agent builds against when turning raw notes, research, or experience into a portable knowledge package:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    N["messy notes<br/>research · experience"] --> A["distill<br/>generators · E1"]
    A --> B["score confidence<br/>from evidence · C1"]
    B --> C["split<br/>index / store · B4"]
    C --> V["adversarial<br/>verify · E4"]
    V --> S["surprise check<br/>F3"]
    S -->|"large error"| M["mint a NEW node"]
    S -->|"else"| K["a portable KPM"]
    M --> K
    classDef step fill:#161b22,stroke:#f0883e,color:#e6edf3
    classDef out fill:#f0883e,stroke:#7a4a25,color:#0d1117
    class N,A,B,C,V,S,M step
    class K out
```

1. **Distill generators, not notes** (E1) — find the irreducible source; don't transcribe elaborations.
2. **Score confidence from evidence** (C1) — check citations; never infer from fluency or recency.
3. **Split index from store** (B4) — KPM = index; research files = store; retrieval completes the join.
4. **Verify before locking** (E4) — run lint (E3) then adversarial challenge; Gettier risk is real.
5. **Mint, don't overwrite, on surprise** (the Surprise Principle, [F3](axioms/F3-surprise-principle.md)) — large prediction error → new node, not in-place edit.

## Challenge it

This doctrine is **defeasible by design** — every axiom is confidence-weighted and built to improve from attack. See **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)**: open a `challenge: <axiom-id>` issue with a real citation, and a well-supported refutation will lower an axiom's confidence, re-scope it, or retire it. The fastest way to make the doctrine better is to try to break it.
