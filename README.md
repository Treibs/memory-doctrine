# The Memory Doctrine

**A theory of how memory works — turned into a standard for knowledge, turned into a tool that packages it. All open, so improving any layer improves them all.**

All three layers are in this repo:

- **The theory** → [`axioms/`](axioms) + [`clusters/`](clusters) — the cited truths, in seven themes.
- **The standard** → [`scripts/doctrine_lint.py`](scripts/doctrine_lint.py) — the checker every package must pass.
- **The tool** → [`tools/package-research`](tools/package-research) — turns your notes into a conformant package.
- **The open edges** → [`OPEN-QUESTIONS.md`](OPEN-QUESTIONS.md) — what the standard hasn't settled yet.

## The problem

Every AI agent has memory — a vector store, a retrieval pipeline, a "memory" feature. But each of those is only the bottom layer: an implementation with no shared, evidence-based account of what memory *is* or what makes it good. So teams rebuild the same intuitions, benchmark by benchmark.

The Memory Doctrine covers all three layers — a theory, the standard that follows from it, and a tool that runs on both. The theory defines the standard; the standard defines what the tool must produce.

## 1 · The theory — how memory actually works

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad5d3a96-5ba4-488b-9b28-5e6f95a40395

> **Memory is a network of generative, confidence-weighted truths** — a graph of ideas where the value lives in the *connections*, each idea carries an *earned* degree of belief, and a few load-bearing ideas *generate* the rest.

Distilled from research across psychology, neuroscience, information theory, AI, and epistemology into **23 cited axioms in seven themes** (the *confidence* in parentheses is how well-evidenced each is, 0–1):

| Theme | The question | The load-bearing finding |
|---|---|---|
| **Structure** | How is knowledge shaped? | Value lives in the **connections, not the nodes** — a note's retrieval budget is finite and splits *logarithmically* across its links, so a junk link measurably dilutes recall of the rest *(0.90)*. One idea per note. |
| **Retrieval** | How is it recalled? | Remembering is **cue-based pattern completion** — and in its formal form, the modern Hopfield update and transformer attention are the same equation *(0.95)*. Recall needs a **sparse index that completes into a rich store** — never merged *(0.92)*. |
| **Truth** | How sure, and how do we know? | **Confidence is earned by evidence** *(0.92)* — and it is *not* truth: in any gist-based store, confidently-false memories are a normal, priced outcome *(0.92)*. Sureness, importance, and recall are **three different things, never collapsed** *(0.93)*. |
| **Dynamics** | How does it change? | You lose the **path, not the belief** — recall fades; confidence doesn't *(0.92)*. Memory re-opens for writing **only under surprise** *(0.85)*. |
| **Method** | How do you build and check it? | Knowledge distills in **bounded layers** — the generative idea on top, elaboration and evidence beneath *(0.93)*. A belief locks only after an **adversarial challenge + a citation check** *(0.93)*. |
| **Meta** | What does it know about itself? | The deep unifications: prediction error is **one quantity behind learning, salience, and belief-revision** — the *Surprise Principle* *(0.88)*; and the geometry of retrieval and the index/store split are **structurally one object — a cognitive map** *(0.83)*. |
| **Prospective** | How does it remember to *act*? | Bind reminders to **things you'll naturally pass by**, not a polling loop *(0.82)*; an open intention stays active and must be *switched off* on completion, not just flagged done *(0.74)*. |

Three results worth pulling out:

- **Retrieval is associative.** An embedding store behaves as an associative memory — so the geometry of your vectors is the structure of your memory.
- **Confidence isn't truth.** Mistaking "feels fluent" for "is true" is the shared root of human false memory *and* AI hallucination — so confidence must be earned, scored, and kept apart from recall.
- **Surprise is the write signal.** Memory updates on the gap between expected and actual.

**Built adversarially, scored honestly.** Every axiom is confidence-scored and cited to primary research; the set survived three independent red-team rounds and a full-text citation purge, and the errors that caught are reported, not hidden. The weakest planks (scored 0.74 and 0.82) are flagged provisional. The full argument and rigor trail are in **[the thesis](thesis/THESIS.md)**.

## 2 · The standard — what a well-formed knowledge package is

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79409107-ead0-42b7-b952-940ddcc9133d

The theory doesn't just describe memory; it determines what a unit of knowledge should look like. Every rule of the standard traces to a finding above — nothing here is arbitrary:

| A knowledge package must… | …because the theory says | …which on disk means |
|---|---|---|
| hold **one idea per note** | knowledge is atomic and composable | each axiom note is self-contained |
| be a **thin index over a rich store** | recall splits the index from the store | `axioms/` point into `evidence/` — never merged |
| **score each idea's confidence**, from evidence | confidence must be earned | `confidence: 0–1`, backed by its cited evidence |
| keep **sureness, importance, recall separate** | they are three different orderings | distinct fields — never one "importance" number |
| use **typed, weighted links** | value is in fan-budgeted edges | `relations:` with typed edges |
| be **distilled in layers** | knowledge layers from generator to evidence | generator on top, elaboration, evidence beneath |
| **lock only after an adversarial challenge** | beliefs survive refutation first | `status: candidate → locked` |
| **carry its own revision rules** | memory revises on new evidence | `contradicts` edges + append-only evidence |

So one idea is one Markdown note with a structured header — the standard *is* a file format:

```yaml
id: B4-index-store-split
type: axiom
cluster: B-retrieval
statement: "A sparse index pattern-completes into a rich store — never merge them…"
generativity: 5          # how much else derives from it
confidence: 0.92         # earned from the cited evidence, not from how it sounds
status: locked           # survived an adversarial challenge
relations:
  supports: [B1-spreading-activation]
  contradicts: []
evidence: [teyler-discenna-1986, mcclelland-1995]   # → into the rich store
```

**A checker verifies it.** A small script ([`scripts/doctrine_lint.py`](scripts/doctrine_lint.py)) checks every rule above: confidence values in range, each axiom cites evidence that actually exists, every link points to a real note, and every evidence note records its source and the date it was checked. The package also passes the package manager's own structural check (`kpm doctor`). A package that fails these checks isn't valid.

**The doctrine follows its own rules.** This repository is itself a package built to the standard — 23 axiom notes indexing 41 evidence notes, each scored and linked, passing the checker. If the rules couldn't be met, the doctrine couldn't have been written to them.

## 3 · The tool — turning notes into a package

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90a96ea8-1cc9-48fb-99ca-602b1ed90801

[`package-research`](tools/package-research) takes a folder of raw notes — research, transcripts, scratch files — and produces a package that passes the checker. It runs the doctrine's method as a pipeline:

1. **Read** the notes and split them into passages, each tagged with where it came from.
2. **Distill** the few load-bearing ideas out of the passages.
3. **Score** each idea's confidence from the evidence actually present — not from how it reads.
4. **Verify** by trying to refute each idea and checking it cites a real source; unsupported ones are dropped.
5. **Split** what survives into a thin index and a rich evidence store, cross-linked.
6. **Write and check** the package — run the linter and `kpm doctor`.

It runs two ways:

- **With an API key**, a model does the distilling, scoring, and verifying.
- **Keyless** — an AI assistant you're already working with does that judgment, and the tool handles the structuring and the checks. Either way the output passes the same gates.

```bash
cd tools/package-research && pip install -e .
package-research run ./my-notes --out ./my-kpm
```

The judgment steps — which ideas, how confident — vary with the model or agent; the structure and the checks don't, so the result is always a valid package even when the thinking varies. There are example input notes in [`tools/package-research/examples`](tools/package-research/examples), and the internals are documented in [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](tools/package-research/ARCHITECTURE.md).

**One honest boundary.** It checks that each idea cites a real passage *from your notes* — it doesn't fact-check against the open web. And it organizes notes you already have; researching a topic from scratch is a separate, larger job.

## Open by design — improve one, improve all

The three layers are tied together *and* open (CC BY 4.0), so a win anywhere propagates:

- **Challenge an axiom** → the theory sharpens → the standard it defines sharpens → the tool produces better packages.
- **Improve the tool** → it stress-tests the standard → which feeds back into the theory.

Most memory systems are a closed bottom layer. Here all three are open, so a correction anywhere propagates: challenge a claim and the standard it defines tightens; improve the tool and it stress-tests the standard.

## Challenge it

This doctrine is **made to be argued with.** Open an issue titled `challenge: <idea>` with a real citation, and a well-supported objection will lower an idea's confidence, narrow it, or retire it. See **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** — and **[OPEN-QUESTIONS.md](OPEN-QUESTIONS.md)** for the gaps the standard hasn't settled yet.
